# miden-agglayer operations runbook

How to **run** the proxy and how to **recover** it. For architecture,
flows, and the recovery-mechanism diagrams, read
[`../ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md) first — this doc does not
duplicate it. For pre-fix snapshot collection (logs / SQL / pod state),
use [`diagnostics.md`](./diagnostics.md). For what to scrape and alert
on, see [`monitoring.md`](./monitoring.md).

Structure:

- **Part 1 — Running the proxy**: startup surface, hard deployment
  constraints, bootstrap.
- **Part 2 — Recovery**: the three recovery mechanisms (R1 automatic
  ladder, R2 `--restore`, R3 account self-heal) and when each applies.
- **Part 3 — Failure-mode catalogue**: step-by-step procedures for
  specific incidents (bali-era content, still applicable).

# Part 1 — Running the proxy

## 1.1 Startup surface

All flags are defined in `src/main.rs` (`struct Command`). The reference
deployment is the `miden-agglayer` service in
[`../../docker-compose.e2e.yml`](../../docker-compose.e2e.yml) — copy
its shape for new environments.

### Core

| Flag | Env | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--port` | — | `8546` | JSON-RPC HTTP listener. **Bind loopback / private net only** — see §1.2. |
| `--miden-node` | — | `http://localhost:57291` | Miden node gRPC URL, or a network name `devnet` / `testnet`. |
| `--miden-store-dir` | — | `$HOME/.miden` | Directory holding `store.sqlite3`, the keystore, and `bridge_accounts.toml`. **Proxy-private** — see §1.2. |
| `--chain-id` | `CHAIN_ID` | `2` | EVM chain ID for `eth_chainId`. |
| `--network-id` | `NETWORK_ID` | `1` | Rollup network ID from the RollupManager (`networkID()`). NOT the chain id. |
| `--database-url` | `DATABASE_URL` | unset | Postgres connection string. Set ⇒ `PgStore` (durable synthetic chain, required in production); unset ⇒ `InMemoryStore` (everything lost on restart). Migrations run in-process at startup. |
| `--bridge-address` | `BRIDGE_ADDRESS` | built-in default | L1 bridge contract address used for synthetic log emission. |

### L1 indexer (GER exit-root resolution)

| Flag | Env | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--l1-rpc-url` | `L1_RPC_URL` | unset | L1 RPC for resolving exit roots. Without it, GERs injected via legacy `insertGlobalExitRoot` store `(NULL, NULL)` roots (see [`../ger-decomposition.md`](../ger-decomposition.md)). |
| `--ger-l1-address` | `GER_L1_ADDRESS` | unset | L1 GER contract address the indexer scrapes for `UpdateL1InfoTree`. |
| `--l1-indexer-from-block` | `L1_INDEXER_FROM_BLOCK` | unset | Operator override: force a forward walk from this L1 block on next boot (STATE-C orphan backfill — Part 3, failure mode F). Remove once the cursor has walked past it. |

### Miden proving

| Flag | Env | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--miden-prover-url` | `MIDEN_PROVER_URL` | unset | gRPC URL of a remote tx-prover. **Set it in production** — in-process local proving is the documented bali OOM cause and `--require-hardening` refuses to start without it. |
| `--miden-prover-timeout-secs` | `MIDEN_PROVER_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `120` | Per-request remote-prover timeout. |
| `--miden-prover-fallback-to-local` | `MIDEN_PROVER_FALLBACK_TO_LOCAL` | `false` | Retry a failed remote proof in-process. Trades OOM safety for availability; default OFF preserves the OOM fix. |
| `--miden-api-key` | `MIDEN_API_KEY` | unset | `authorization: Bearer` header on outbound Miden gRPC (gateway rate-limit bypass). Redacted in logs. |

### Security / hardening

| Flag | Env | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--admin-api-key` | `ADMIN_API_KEY` | unset | Gates `admin_*` JSON-RPC (Bearer token, constant-time compare). Unset ⇒ `admin_*` rejected entirely. |
| `--allowed-signers` | `ALLOWED_SIGNERS` | unset | Comma-separated signer allow-list for `eth_sendRawTransaction`. Unset = open mode — only safe behind a private network boundary. |
| `--cors-allowed-origins` | `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | unset | Omit to disable CORS (safe production default). `*` is DEV ONLY. |
| `--rate-limit-per-second` / `--rate-limit-burst` | `RATE_LIMIT_PER_SECOND` / `RATE_LIMIT_BURST` | `500` / `500` | Per-IP rate limit. |
| `--reject-zero-padding-addresses` | `REJECT_ZERO_PADDING_ADDRESSES` | `false` | Refuse the address-mapper zero-padding fallback (production posture). |
| `--disable-hardhat-alias` | `DISABLE_HARDHAT_ALIAS` | `false` | Refuse the well-known Hardhat address remap (Cantina MA#8). **MUST be set in production.** |
| `--require-hardening` | `REQUIRE_HARDENING` | `false` | Startup invariant: refuse to boot unless `ADMIN_API_KEY`, `ALLOWED_SIGNERS`, `MIDEN_PROVER_URL`, `DISABLE_HARDHAT_ALIAS` are set and CORS is not `*`. Set it on any internet-adjacent deployment. |
| `--miden-debug` | `MIDEN_DEBUG` | `false` | Verbose Miden VM traces. Disable in production. |

### Writer worker (RD-940)

| Flag / env | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `AGGLAYER_WRITER_QUEUE_DEPTH` (env only) | `64` | mpsc capacity. |
| `AGGLAYER_WRITER_TX_TTL` (env only) | `300` | Maximum queue age before the consuming worker fails a job prior to dispatch; also terminal-cache retention. Submitting work is never failed by the sweeper. |
| `AGGLAYER_CLAIM_RECEIPT_EXPIRATION_BLOCKS` (env only) | `120` | Miden-block lifetime of pending claim receipts waiting for the projector to observe claim-note consumption. |

### One-shot / recovery flags

Never present in steady state (a pod showing any of these in `Args` is
mid-recovery):

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--init` | Greenfield bootstrap: mints on-chain infrastructure accounts, writes `bridge_accounts.toml` into `--miden-store-dir`. **Never re-run on a deployed cluster** (Part 3, "Procedures we deliberately do NOT document"). |
| `--restore` | Rebuild the proxy store (synthetic events, GER set, deposit_count) from the Miden node, then exit. See §R2. |
| `--reset-miden-store` | Wipe `store.sqlite3` (+ WAL/SHM) before starting. Keystore and `bridge_accounts.toml` are preserved. Combine with `--restore`. See §R2. |
| `--unlock-miden-accounts` | Clear the `locked` flag on every miden-client account row, then exit. See §R3. |

### Environment requirements

- **`TMPDIR` must be on the same device as `--miden-store-dir`.** rusqlite
  (and rocksdb) perform atomic renames from `TMPDIR` into the store dir;
  a cross-device `TMPDIR` fails at startup with
  `Invalid cross-device link`. The compose file sets
  `TMPDIR: /var/lib/miden-agglayer-service/tmp` inside the same bind
  mount for this reason. Named docker volumes trip the same error — use
  bind mounts.
- `RUST_LOG=info` is the operational baseline; the health line and all
  recovery chatter documented in `monitoring.md` are INFO/WARN.

## 1.2 Hard deployment constraints

### Exactly ONE proxy replica

The proxy **cannot be horizontally scaled**. Two structural reasons:

1. **`MidenClient` is a process-wide singleton** — the single owner of
   `store.sqlite3`. All Miden work (sync, claims, GER, proving)
   serializes through its one event loop. An in-process guard refuses a
   second client (`"a MidenClient is already live — MidenClient must be
   a process-wide singleton"`), but nothing stops a second *replica*
   from opening its own copy of the store and submitting conflicting
   transactions from the same bridge accounts (nonce/mempool conflicts,
   the postmortem's IAIC class).
2. **The `SyntheticProjector` is the sole producer** of the synthetic
   chain (one synthetic block per Miden block, write-before-advance).
   Two projectors against one Postgres would race the cursor and the
   tip; two projectors against two stores would serve two diverging
   chains to aggkit.

Deploy as a StatefulSet/deployment with `replicas: 1` and no HPA. If an
orchestrator ever runs two pods concurrently against the same
`--miden-store-dir`, expect `database is locked` in the logs (must be
0 — see `monitoring.md`).

### The miden store + keystore are proxy-private

`store.sqlite3`, the keystore, and `bridge_accounts.toml` under
`--miden-store-dir` belong to the proxy process **only**:

- **External B2AGG wallets must NEVER share `store.sqlite3`.** This is
  both the production topology (withdrawing users run their own wallet
  client with their own store and keys — see the external-wallet lane in
  `ARCHITECTURE.md`) and the DB-lock isolation result: any tool opening
  the proxy's sqlite concurrently contends with the live `MidenClient`
  and produces `database is locked` / corruption. The prod-faithful
  loadtest (`scripts/e2e-bridge-loadtest-isolated.sh`) exists precisely
  to prove the proxy generates zero lock errors when nothing external
  touches its store.
- Same rule for humans: **never run `miden-cli` against the live store**
  (Part 3, "Procedures we deliberately do NOT document"). Snapshot-copy
  the file first.

### Bind RPC to loopback / private networks

The JSON-RPC port must not be exposed to the internet. A host that
briefly bound `0.0.0.0` received continuous wallet-scanner probes
(`web3_clientVersion`, `parity_netPeers`, `debug_*` — visible as
`JSON-RPC unsupported method` error lines in the logs). The compose file
binds `127.0.0.1:8546:8546`; keep that shape, or front the port with a
private network / firewall. If any non-trusted network can reach the
port, set `--require-hardening` plus `ALLOWED_SIGNERS` and
`ADMIN_API_KEY` — the rate limiter alone is not an exposure strategy.

## 1.3 Bootstrap (greenfield only)

One-time, per fresh environment:

```bash
# creates + funds the bridge / ger_manager / faucet accounts on Miden and
# writes bridge_accounts.toml into --miden-store-dir
miden-agglayer-service --init \
  --miden-node=<grpc-url> \
  --miden-store-dir=<dir> \
  [--miden-prover-url=<prover>]
```

Then start normally (without `--init`). The compose e2e stack does this
automatically. Re-running `--init` on an existing deployment mints new
accounts and orphans all balances held by the old ones — see Part 3.

---

# Part 2 — Recovery

Three mechanisms at three layers. Diagrams and full rationale:
[`../ARCHITECTURE.md` → "Recovery flows"](../ARCHITECTURE.md#recovery-flows).

| | Mechanism | Trigger | Operator action |
|---|---|---|---|
| **R1** | Live note-recovery ladder (reconciler + late sweep + direct recovery) | Automatic, every projector tick | **None** |
| **R2** | `--restore` / `--reset-miden-store --restore` | Operator, after data loss / store divergence | Run the one-shot, restart |
| **R3** | Account self-heal (`import_account_by_id` + retry) | Automatic, per failed submission | None (escalate only if it loops) |

## R1 — Live recovery ladder (automatic — needs NO operator action)

Externally-created network notes (B2AGG bridge-outs) that are committed
*and* consumed between two proxy sync points are invisible to
miden-client's interest-based sync. The projector heals this in-process,
every tick, with three escalating catchers (late-consumption sweep →
note reconciler → direct spent-before-import recovery).

**What its chatter means** — these logs/metrics are the ladder *working*,
not failing:

| Signal | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `note reconciler: imported network notes missed by sync` + `synthetic_reconciler_notes_imported_total` | Catcher 2 back-filled notes the sync missed. Normal background healing. | None |
| WARN `note reconciler: import silently dropped consumed notes; attempting direct projection recovery` + `synthetic_reconciler_import_dropped_total` | miden-client 0.15 silently drops imports of already-spent notes; the ladder escalates to catcher 3 automatically. WARN-level **normal**. | None |
| `spent-before-import recovery: bridge-consumed B2AGG verified via sync_transactions` + `synthetic_reconciler_direct_recovered_total` | Catcher 3 recovered a fast-consumed note with on-chain consumer proof. | None |
| `late-consumption sweep: projecting notes discovered after their block` | Catcher 1 projected a note into the first unexposed block. Consumers cannot have skipped it (write-before-advance). | None |
| WARN `... consumed B2AGG was NOT consumed by any bridge transaction at its spend block` + `synthetic_reconciler_unverified_consumption_total` | MA#3 fail-closed gate: consumption exists but the bridge did not execute it — sender reclaim or unknown consumer. **No BridgeEvent is emitted on purpose.** | **Investigate** (see `monitoring.md`) |
| ERROR `... note missing from store but its nullifier is unspent` + `synthetic_reconciler_missing_not_consumed_total` | A note the reconciler expected is neither imported nor consumed. Restart re-sweeps from genesis and retries. | **Investigate** if it repeats |

The ladder is idempotent and retry-safe: a restart re-sweeps from
genesis (known ids are skipped), so transient failures self-heal on the
next boot. The end-to-end health line is
`synthetic projector tick: caught up to Miden tip` with
`miden_tip == projector_cursor == synthetic_tip` (see `monitoring.md`).

## R2 — Startup restore (operator-driven disaster recovery)

Rebuilds the proxy store (synthetic events, GER set, hash chain,
deposit_count) from the Miden node. Runs as a **one-shot**: the process
replays and exits; you then start the proxy normally.

**When to use which:**

| Situation | Command |
|---|---|
| Proxy store (Postgres) lost/corrupt; miden-client sqlite fine | `--restore` |
| miden-client sqlite diverged/corrupt (AccountDataNotFound after R3 failed, structural divergence, disk loss) | `--reset-miden-store --restore` |
| Only symptom is a stale account lock | Don't — use `--unlock-miden-accounts` (§R3) |

**Exact commands** (compose deployment; k8s variant in Part 3, failure
mode A.2):

```bash
# 1. Stop the running proxy (never run restore concurrently with it).
docker compose -f docker-compose.e2e.yml --env-file fixtures/.env stop miden-agglayer

# 2. One-shot. `docker compose run` overrides the command, so re-supply
#    the base flags your deployment uses.
docker compose -f docker-compose.e2e.yml --env-file fixtures/.env \
  run --rm --no-deps miden-agglayer \
  --port=8546 \
  --miden-node=http://miden-node:57291 \
  --miden-store-dir=/var/lib/miden-agglayer-service \
  --l1-rpc-url=http://anvil:8545 \
  --ger-l1-address=<ger-l1-address> \
  --reset-miden-store \
  --restore

# 3. Expected log markers, in order:
#    reset_miden_store: deleted .../store.sqlite3       (only with --reset-miden-store)
#    === RESTORE: starting state reconstruction ===
#    Phase 0: re-importing bridge accounts from Miden node...
#    reimported from node                                (per network-tracked account)
#    Phase 1: sync ...
#    === RESTORE: complete ===
#    then the process exits 0.

# 4. Start the proxy normally.
docker compose -f docker-compose.e2e.yml --env-file fixtures/.env start miden-agglayer
```

The operator-faithful rehearsal of this procedure is
`scripts/e2e-reset-restore-recovery.sh`.

**What survives:**

- The **keystore** and **`bridge_accounts.toml`** — explicitly preserved
  by `--reset-miden-store` (only `store.sqlite3` + WAL/SHM are deleted).
- The Postgres store's dedup keys — replay is idempotent, existing
  events are not duplicated.
- All on-chain state (obviously).

**Caveat — R2 replays the LOCAL view.** Restore's replay reads the
consumed-note view that sync can deliver; notes that were invisible to
sync (the fast-consumption class) are *not* recovered by the replay
itself. That is fine: after startup, **R1's reconciler re-sweeps from
genesis and heals the remainder** automatically. Expect a burst of
`synthetic_reconciler_notes_imported_total` /
`synthetic_reconciler_direct_recovered_total` in the first minutes after
a restore — that is the system finishing the job, not a new problem.

**Phase 0 requirement:** account reimport works only for accounts
deployed `Public` (all infra accounts deployed by current `--init` are).
`Private` legacy accounts fail reimport with `AccountIsPrivate` — see
Part 3, failure mode A.2 caveat.

## R3 — Account self-heal (automatic)

On `AccountDataNotFound` / `IncorrectAccountInitialCommitment` during a
claim or GER submission, the proxy re-imports the affected account's
live public state from the node (`import_account_by_id`) and retries the
submission once. Watch `miden_account_reimport_total{account,outcome}`
and the paired logs `reimported from node` / `account reimport failed`.

- One firing per incident is the mechanism working. **No action.**
- Repeated firings for the same account in steady state = chronic
  divergence → escalate to R2 (`--reset-miden-store --restore`).

Related surgical tool — stale lock only:

```bash
# one-shot: clears the `locked` flag on every managed account row, exits.
miden-agglayer-service --unlock-miden-accounts --miden-store-dir=<dir>
```

Use when `miden_locked_accounts_detected_total > 0` at startup and there
is no other divergence symptom (Part 3, failure mode A.1 has the k8s
procedure).

# Part 3 — Failure-mode catalogue

Step-by-step recovery procedures for the failure modes we know about,
originally written for the bali cluster. Section A's *symptoms* are now
largely pre-emptied by R3 (self-heal) — reach for these procedures when
the automatic mechanisms have demonstrably failed.

## How to use this catalogue

1. Identify the failure mode (most recently fired alert; or the verdict
   block from the diagnostic skill).
2. Jump to the matching section.
3. Read the **blast radius** + **rollback** lines before executing.
4. Note that anything labelled `<TODO: ...>` requires confirmation from
   Max before running on bali — the underlying behaviour hasn't been
   confirmed in this revision of the doc.

## Common preamble — port-forwards + secrets

Most procedures need at least one of:

```bash
# Proxy DB
kubectl -n outpost-testnet-miden-testnet port-forward svc/miden-agglayer-db 15434:5432 &

# Bridge-service DB
kubectl -n outpost-testnet-miden-testnet port-forward svc/bridge-db 15435:5432 &

# Service JSON-RPC
kubectl -n outpost-testnet-miden-testnet port-forward svc/miden-agglayer 8546:8546 &

# Verify all listeners came up
ss -tlnp | grep -E ':(8546|1543[45])'
```

Read the DB passwords from secrets — never paste them into chat:

```bash
export PROXY_PG_PASSWORD="$(
  kubectl -n outpost-testnet-miden-testnet get secret miden-agglayer-secret \
    -o jsonpath='{.data.database_url}' \
  | base64 -d | grep -oP 'password=\K[^ ]+')"

# Bridge-service password lives in 1Password.
# <TODO: confirm 1Password item name with Max>
```

`kubectl exec`-free SQL via docker:

```bash
docker run --rm --network host -e PGPASSWORD="$PROXY_PG_PASSWORD" postgres:17-alpine \
  psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 15434 -U agglayer -d agglayer_store -c "<query>"
```

---

## Failure mode A — AccountDataNotFound / IAIC

Symptoms in logs:

- `account data wasn't found for account id 0x<id>`, OR
- `incorrect account initial commitment`, OR
- gRPC tail `transaction conflicts with current mempool state`.

In Prometheus: `MidenAgglayerAccountDivergence` alert firing; recently:
no fresh rows in `transactions` with `status='success'`.

Background: see [`../POSTMORTEM_2026-05-11_IAIC_TO_ADNF.md`](../POSTMORTEM_2026-05-11_IAIC_TO_ADNF.md).
Both symptoms map to the same class of fault — local miden-client store
diverged from on-chain state.

> **R3 first:** on current builds the runtime self-heal
> (`miden_account_reimport_total`) fires on exactly these errors and
> retries once. A single firing that clears the symptom needs no
> operator action. Proceed below only when the reimport itself fails or
> the symptom recurs.

### A.1 Is it just a stale lock?

`miden_locked_accounts_detected_total > 0` at last startup, or startup
logs include:

```
src/main.rs: startup diagnostic: 1 managed account(s) are LOCKED in miden-client
```

Surgical unlock — preserves all local state (milliseconds), no
re-sync needed:

```bash
kubectl -n outpost-testnet-miden-testnet patch statefulset miden-agglayer \
  --type='json' \
  -p='[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-","value":"--unlock-miden-accounts"}]'

kubectl -n outpost-testnet-miden-testnet rollout status statefulset miden-agglayer --watch

# Expect "unlocked N row(s)" then the pod exits cleanly.

# Remove the flag and let the pod restart normally
kubectl -n outpost-testnet-miden-testnet patch statefulset miden-agglayer \
  --type='json' \
  -p='[{"op":"remove","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/<index-of-flag>"}]'
```

**Blast radius:** writes to `latest_account_headers` +
`historical_account_headers` in miden-client sqlite. Reversible — locks
are recovered from the node on the next sync if they were correct.

**Rollback:** none needed. The flag is idempotent; re-running it is safe.

### A.2 Full miden-store reset

Required when `--unlock-miden-accounts` doesn't clear the symptom — the
local sqlite has structurally diverged. This is recovery mechanism
**R2** (Part 2) — the compose-shaped command lives there; the k8s
procedure follows.

> **READ FIRST:** the runbook for this on bali specifically is
> [`../REDEPLOY_RUNBOOK_BALI.md`](../REDEPLOY_RUNBOOK_BALI.md). It captures the v0.4.1 version
> requirement, GER state assertions, and the cure-event log signatures
> we expect after redeploy. Follow that doc on bali; this section is the
> generic procedure for other clusters.

Procedure:

```bash
# 1. Confirm the pod image is at least v0.3.0 (Phase 0 reimport in
#    restore.rs is required for AccountDataNotFound recovery to work).
kubectl -n <namespace> describe pod <pod> | grep Image:

# 2. Add the recovery flags. Order matters: --reset wipes sqlite, then
#    --restore reimports accounts + replays state from the node + L1.
kubectl -n <namespace> patch statefulset miden-agglayer \
  --type='json' \
  -p='[
    {"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-","value":"--reset-miden-store"},
    {"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-","value":"--restore"}
  ]'

kubectl -n <namespace> rollout status statefulset miden-agglayer --watch

# 3. Expected boot log sequence:
#    INFO recovery.rs: reset_miden_store: deleted .../store.sqlite3
#    INFO restore.rs: === RESTORE: starting state reconstruction ===
#    INFO Phase 0: re-importing bridge accounts from Miden node...
#    INFO Phase 0 complete: bridge account reimport pass done
#    INFO Phase 1: sync_miden_block ...
#    INFO === RESTORE: complete ===
#    Then pod exits (return Ok). Kubernetes restarts it without the
#    recovery flags by virtue of step 4.

# 4. CRITICAL — remove the flags before the pod restarts again, otherwise
#    every restart loops through reset+restore and never serves traffic.
kubectl -n <namespace> patch statefulset miden-agglayer \
  --type='json' \
  -p='[
    {"op":"remove","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/<index-of-restore>"},
    {"op":"remove","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/<index-of-reset>"}
  ]'

# 5. Watch for the first successful GER inject post-recovery:
kubectl -n <namespace> logs -f <pod> | grep -E 'UpdateGerNote transaction committed|account data wasn'
```

**Blast radius:** deletes `store.sqlite3` (+ WAL/SHM) in the pod's
PersistentVolume. Keystore + `bridge_accounts.toml` are preserved
explicitly by `recovery::reset_miden_store`. The proxy's PgStore and
all on-chain state are untouched.

**Post-restore:** expect a burst of R1 reconciler activity
(`synthetic_reconciler_notes_imported_total`,
`synthetic_reconciler_direct_recovered_total`) — the replay only covers
the local sync view; the ladder's genesis re-sweep heals the
fast-consumed remainder. See Part 2, §R2.

**Caveat:** Phase 0 reimport requires accounts to be `Public` storage
mode. The bali infrastructure accounts deployed before commit `34d4316`
(pre-v0.3.0) are `Private` — for those, `import_account_by_id` returns
`AccountIsPrivate` and the reimport silently fails for that account.
This is the case bali is in today — `<TODO: confirm with Max whether
bali's accounts have been redeployed as Public yet; if not, full reset
is not a safe option and the only recourse is the v0.4.1 redeploy
documented in REDEPLOY_RUNBOOK_BALI.md>`.

**Rollback:** none. If `restore` left the system worse, you must
escalate to Max + Igor for a manual rebuild of bridge_accounts.toml
against fresh accounts.

### A.3 The IAIC variant (mempool conflict, not store divergence)

If the gRPC tail is literally `transaction conflicts with current mempool
state` and not `incorrect account initial commitment` alone, the cause is
mempool serialisation, not local cache lag. This class of error was
**closed structurally in v0.3.0** by routing all submissions through the
`MidenClient` channel-of-1 — so on any v0.3.0+ deployment, observing a
fresh IAIC means something has reintroduced a parallel-submit path.

If a fresh IAIC fires on a v0.3.0+ deployment:

1. Capture a 30-minute Loki window around the first occurrence.
2. Look for two concurrent `submit_proven_transaction` calls in the same
   timestamp bucket — that's the regression signature. A second replica
   or an external tool sharing the miden store produces the same
   signature — re-check the §1.2 constraints before blaming the code.
3. Open an incident ticket and **page the maintainer** before redeploying.
   A self-heal will mask the regression but not fix it.

## Failure mode B — Stuck L1→L2 deposit (no claim arriving on L2)

User report: "I sent ETH on Sepolia, the bridge-service shows my deposit
but no balance has appeared on Miden."

Use the trace in [`diagnostics.md` section 4](./diagnostics.md#4-trace-a-single-l1l2-deposit)
to localise the wedge to one of:

- **Bridge-service hasn't marked the deposit `ready_for_claim`.** Cause:
  bridge-service hasn't ingested a GER that covers the deposit yet. Look
  at proxy `ger_entries` — is there a recent injected row? If not, see
  failure mode E.
- **Bridge-service is `ready_for_claim=true` but no CLAIM has landed on
  the proxy.** Cause: claim sponsor / ClaimTxManager isn't picking the
  deposit up. Check claim sponsor logs in
  `<TODO: confirm aggkit claimsponsor pod name on bali — likely aggkit-0>`.
- **CLAIM submission keeps failing on the proxy.** Cause: failure mode A
  is firing — go fix that first.
- **CLAIM committed on Miden but the user's balance didn't change.**
  Cause: address mapping fell back to zero-padding for an address that
  doesn't exist on Miden (counter
  `address_mapper_zero_padding_fallback_total` incremented). The mint
  happened to a synthesised account that nobody can spend. **Page Max**
  before proceeding — this needs a deliberate decision on whether to
  re-issue.

For the recovery cure that unsticks marti's deposits specifically, the
v0.4.1 redeploy in [`../REDEPLOY_RUNBOOK_BALI.md`](../REDEPLOY_RUNBOOK_BALI.md) is the procedure of
record.

## Failure mode C — Stuck L2→L1 withdrawal (no claim landing on L1)

User report: "I burned my Miden balance via a B2AGG note, the L2 logs
show `BridgeEvent`, but I never received ETH on Sepolia."

Trace via [`diagnostics.md` section 5](./diagnostics.md#5-trace-a-single-l2l1-withdrawal).
Possible wedges:

1. **`BridgeEvent` not emitted on L2.** On projector-era builds the
   event is emitted by the `SyntheticProjector` (with the R1 recovery
   ladder catching fast-consumed notes), so a genuinely missing
   BridgeEvent is now rare and *audit-able*: run
   [`scripts/verify-event-completeness.sh`](./diagnostics.md#10-event-integrity-audit--verify-event-completenesssh)
   to prove presence/absence against the node DB. If it is missing,
   check `synthetic_reconciler_unverified_consumption_total` (MA#3
   fail-closed reclaim gate — intentional non-emission) and
   `bridge_out_unknown_faucet_total` (faucet not in registry —
   quarantined by design; permanently stuck until the registry is
   updated).
2. **AggLayer certificate not built.** Look in aggsender logs for the
   `BridgeEvent` block — does aggsender pick up the event?
   `<TODO: confirm aggsender pod name and logs path on bali>`.
3. **Certificate built but ClaimSettler hasn't auto-claimed on L1.**
   Inspect ClaimSettler config: `CLAIM_SETTLER_ENABLED=true`,
   `CLAIM_SETTLER_WATCH_ADDRESSES` covers the destination address, the
   signer L1 balance is sufficient.

### C.1 ClaimSettler signer is dry

Signer address is logged at startup as
`ClaimSettler: signing as <address>`. Check balance:

```bash
cast balance <signer_address> --rpc-url "$SEPOLIA_RPC_URL"
```

Top-up procedure: `<TODO: confirm bali claimsponsor funding source with
Max — likely the gateway-treasury 1Password "Sepolia faucet" entry>`.

**Blast radius:** L1 ETH spend, irreversible.

---

## Failure mode D — Bridge invariant violation (Cantina hard-page metrics)

If any of these counters increment, the safe action is to **stop processing
new claims and bridge-outs** until the cause is understood:

- `bridge_burn_serial_collision_total`
- `bridge_twin_note_detected_total`
- `bridge_mint_target_mismatch_total`
- `bridge_faucet_ownership_drift_total{kind=renounced}`
- `bridge_forged_mint_total`

### D.1 Stop the world

There is **no clean "pause" flag**. The least-bad approximation:

```bash
# Scale the StatefulSet to 0 — refuses all JSON-RPC, breaks the
# aggoracle / aggsender / claim sponsor loop until restored.
kubectl -n <namespace> scale statefulset miden-agglayer --replicas=0
```

**Blast radius:** all bridging halts in both directions. Aggsender will
queue events; aggoracle will retry. This is the right action for a
suspected exploit. Do not unwind without explicit go from Max + Igor.

**Rollback:**

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> scale statefulset miden-agglayer --replicas=1
```

(Never scale back above 1 — see §1.2.)

### D.2 Capture evidence

Before any further action, snapshot the proxy DB:

```bash
# <TODO: confirm pg_dump RBAC permissions and S3 destination bucket>
PGPASSWORD="$PROXY_PG_PASSWORD" pg_dump -h 127.0.0.1 -p 15434 \
  -U agglayer -d agglayer_store \
  -F c -f bali-agglayer-store-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ).pgdump
```

Snapshot the relevant Loki window:

```logql
{namespace="outpost-testnet-miden-testnet", container="miden-agglayer"}
  |~ "bridge_invariant_violation"
```

Open an incident ticket with the metric name + violation kind + the
NoteId / AccountId mentioned in the WARN/ERROR log line.

## Failure mode E — Aggoracle pushed a GER but it didn't land

Symptoms:

- bridge-service log shows aggoracle calling `insertGlobalExitRoot`
  (or `updateExitRoot`) against the proxy,
- proxy `ger_entries` does **not** show a corresponding row, OR shows
  the row with `is_injected=FALSE`.

### E.1 Step 1: which RPC method did aggoracle use?

Check the aggkit config:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> get configmap aggkit-config -o yaml | grep UseUpdateExitRoot
```

If `UseUpdateExitRoot = false`, aggoracle is using the legacy
`insertGlobalExitRoot(combinedGER)` path, which **must** be paired with
the L1InfoTreeIndexer to backfill the two roots. Confirm
`L1_RPC_URL` + `GER_L1_ADDRESS` (or `--l1-rpc-url` / `--ger-l1-address`)
are set on the proxy pod. If they aren't, the proxy stores `(NULL, NULL)`
roots permanently (the failure documented in [`../ger-decomposition.md`](../ger-decomposition.md)).

Fix: set the env vars + restart, OR flip `UseUpdateExitRoot = true` and
restart aggkit (preferred — closes the race entirely, see RD-862).

### E.2 Step 2: indexer falling behind?

```bash
kubectl logs <pod> -n <namespace> --tail=2000 \
  | grep 'L1InfoTreeIndexer polled' | tail -5
```

If `head` is many blocks ahead of `to`, the indexer is behind L1. Causes
to consider:

- L1 RPC slow / rate-limited (Infura quota burnt).
- The pod OOMKilled recently — each restart resets the cursor to current
  L1 head and forgets the in-progress window (`<TODO: confirm whether
  the v0.4.0 cursor persistence in migration 005 has fully closed this
  failure mode>`).
- L1 reorg backed up the indexer's reverification logic.

### E.3 Step 3: Miden submission failing?

If the GER row in `ger_entries` has `is_injected=FALSE` and the proxy
keeps trying:

```logql
{namespace="<ns>", container="miden-agglayer"}
  |~ "UpdateGerNote.*failed|NoteScreener|FetchAssetWitnessFailed|RootNotInStore"
```

The NoteScreener bypass design (see [`../ger-note-screening-bypass.md`](../ger-note-screening-bypass.md))
should handle the `RootNotInStore` class. If you see
`FetchAssetWitnessFailed` repeating *after* the split-submit path, the
bypass has regressed — escalate.

## Failure mode F — STATE-C orphan backfill (historic poisoned GERs)

The 27 race-poisoned GER rows on bali — `is_injected=TRUE`,
`mainnet_exit_root IS NULL`, `rollup_exit_root IS NULL` — exist from the
pre-`UseUpdateExitRoot` era. They are **not blocking current bridging**
(see ger-decomposition.md: newer GERs supersede older ones), so the
backfill is cosmetic.

To clean them up:

1. Find the earliest orphan's L1 block (the indexer needs to walk back
   to before the orphan was injected to re-emit the matching
   `UpdateL1InfoTree`). Use 30 days before today as a safe lower bound.
2. Patch the StatefulSet with `--l1-indexer-from-block=<N>` and wait for
   the indexer cursor to walk past current head.
3. Remove the flag.
4. Verify: `SELECT count(*) FROM ger_entries WHERE is_injected AND mainnet_exit_root IS NULL;` returns 0.

Full procedure is in
[`../REDEPLOY_RUNBOOK_BALI.md` step 4](../REDEPLOY_RUNBOOK_BALI.md#step-4--clean-up-the-27-historic-state-c-orphans-optional)
and is identical for any cluster.

## Failure mode G — Stale account lock

`miden_locked_accounts_detected_total > 0` at startup; no other
divergence symptoms. See section A.1 above for the `--unlock-miden-accounts`
procedure.

---

## Procedures we deliberately do NOT document

These need explicit case-by-case authorisation; copy-paste recovery
would be dangerous.

- **`--init` re-run on a deployed cluster.** Mints new on-chain
  infrastructure accounts and overwrites `bridge_accounts.toml`. Any
  asset balance held by the old accounts is unrecoverable. Only safe on
  greenfield deployments. Max owns the decision.
- **Manual SQL UPDATE against `ger_entries`.** The race-orphan backfill
  is preferred (failure mode F). A direct UPDATE bypasses the proof that
  the (mainnet, rollup) pair is consistent with the combined hash, which
  is the only safety property keeping bridge-service from accepting
  forged roots.
- **PgStore restore from `pg_dump`.** Splices live on-chain state with a
  stale snapshot of synthetic state. Likely to break the deterministic
  hash chain. Use the in-process `--restore` flag instead — it rebuilds
  from authoritative sources.
- **Manual `kubectl exec` against the running miden-agglayer pod to run
  miden-client CLI.** The pod's miden-client sqlite is locked by the
  long-lived `MidenClient` event loop; concurrent access from a CLI
  invocation will corrupt it. Use a separate diagnostic pod or local
  copy via `kubectl cp` of a snapshot.

# RD-940 writer worker — operational scenarios

Last updated: 2026-05-27 (RD-940 rollout).

For incident scenarios touching the bridge as a whole, also consult
`docs/POSTMORTEM_2026-05-11_IAIC_TO_ADNF.md` and the linked Cantina
audit notes.

## Failure mode I — durable writer recovery after restart (RD-940)

**Symptom:** a previously accepted hash remains pending after a worker restart.

**Cause:** the mpsc dispatch buffer is process-local, but the full signed envelope
is persisted as an unlinked pending transaction before the nonce CAS. The nonce
reservation is permanently bound to that hash and its live lease stops renewing
when the process dies.

### Response

1. Re-broadcast the **same signed transaction** after the reservation lease
   (`NONCE_RESERVATION_LEASE_SECS`, default 90 s) expires. The service re-decodes
   the durable envelope, accepts the already-advanced nonce, and enqueues once.
2. Never replace it with a different hash at the same nonce; replacement is
   fail-closed because the prior external outcome may be ambiguous.
3. If the transaction already has a note link, do not force recovery: the
   external submission boundary was crossed and the projector owns finalisation.
4. `agglayer_writer_dropped_on_restart_total` remains a restart-pressure signal,
   not a count of unrecoverable work. Alert and investigate repeated restarts or
   queue saturation, then verify same-hash recovery and nonce continuity.

## Coordinated downstream change — k8s `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`

The graceful drain path in `main.rs` waits up to **20 s** before
snapshotting residual jobs. Kubernetes' default
`terminationGracePeriodSeconds = 30 s` includes the time between the
SIGTERM and the SIGKILL that follows; with axum's own shutdown delay
plus the 20 s drain plus a small buffer, **bali's pod spec MUST set
`terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 45`** before deploying this release.

This change lives in the downstream `gateway-deploy` repo (not in
miden-agglayer). Coordinate the deploy-spec edit with the agglayer rollout;
deploying it first avoids a window where the drain is silently truncated by
SIGKILL.

There is no HPA or PDB on the miden-agglayer pod today, so the bump has
no cascading effect.

## Single-writer deployment procedure

1. **Pre-flight checks.**
   - `kubectl get deploy/miden-agglayer -o yaml` shows
     `terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 45`.
   - Latest miden-agglayer build includes the RD-940 commits.
   - Prometheus is scraping the writer metrics.
   - Alerts in `monitoring.md` are armed.
2. **Deploy and restart the pod.** The single writer starts unconditionally.
3. **First 10 minutes — eyes on the dashboard.**
   - `agglayer_writer_queue_depth` should stay well under 0.5 × cap
     (32 with the default cap of 64).
   - `agglayer_writer_job_failures_total{reason="ttl"}` should stay 0.
     Any non-zero rate means a job waited in the local queue longer than
     `AGGLAYER_WRITER_TX_TTL` (default 300 s) before dispatch began.
   - `agglayer_writer_dropped_on_restart_total` must be 0; non-zero means the
     previous boot left queued or submitting work.
4. **First 24 hours.** Compare `agglayer_writer_job_duration_seconds`
   p99 against aggkit's `WaitTxToBeMined` budget (2 m). Stay below 60
   s; alert if the p99 climbs above 90 s for 10 min.
5. **Rollback.** There is no synchronous-mode toggle: it violates the invariant
   that accepted work outlives the HTTP request. Roll back the whole release
   only after draining or accounting for all pending transactions.

## Environment-variable overrides

| Env var | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `AGGLAYER_WRITER_QUEUE_DEPTH` | `64` | mpsc capacity. At 64 + p50 commit ≈ 10 s, sustainable throughput tops near 6 jobs/s. Bump if `queue_full_rejections` rate climbs. |
| `AGGLAYER_WRITER_TX_TTL` | `300` (5 min) | Maximum queue age before the consuming worker writes `status:0x0` without starting dispatch; also retention time for terminal in-memory entries. The sweeper renews live reservations and evicts terminal entries, but never fails Submitting work concurrently. |
| `AGGLAYER_CLAIM_RECEIPT_EXPIRATION_BLOCKS` | `120` | Miden-block lifetime for pending claim receipts that wait for the projector to observe claim-note consumption. Increase if valid claims expire before projection under load. |
